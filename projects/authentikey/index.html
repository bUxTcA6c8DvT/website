Security is a big topic today as 2 factor auth is now mandated by many apps such as Chrome Web Store and the Play Store. But to get security at its best one needs to enable two factor auth on many different accounts. This creates a conundrum as managing all of your accounts can be difficult in itself. Without a good app to keep track of them all you could very well lock yourself out of your own account! This project’s goal was to design a solution for a super user’s case of working with lots of two factor auth accounts. This is a mobile app geared for both your average user and super users of two factor auth.</p></div></section><section><h3>Competitive Audit</h3><div><p>Looking at several apps: Google Authenticator, Microsoft authenticator, and Authy.</p><p>There’s a lot of room in the market for a good authenticator app. While there are several big brands out there that support Security Code generating apps, none of them seem to expect a user to have that many accounts. While this may be true currently, it is certainly not for super users and for the increasing trend of two factor requirements. Currently 57% of companies around the world offer two factor services according to Last Pass. And large companies such as Amazon, Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Instagram, and Intuit already offer such services. There’s 7 accounts already. What a trend to be missing out on.</p></div></section><section><h3>Here’s some market opportunities for a good authenticator app:</h3><div><ul><Li>Lack of search and filters for when you have many accounts.</Li><Li>Many of the existing options lack auth support for non-standard schemes such as steam or authy</Li><Li>Lack of customization options. It can be hard to find the accounts because you can’t customize their display. So if you have a lot they all look the same. </Li></ul></div></section><section><h3>These are the target user groups that are defined.</h3><div><p>Super User: </p><ul><li>A user with many accounts 20+</li><li>A user who cares a lot about security</li><li>A user who needs the app every time they login to a service.

Filter by categories and search for  usernames or entities. Search and filtering is key to solving the user problem of having lots of accounts.</Li><Li><b>Provide customization of visual elements</b><br />Visual elements help users find the account they’re looking for, fast. Customize a photo of the entity you’re saving a two factor auth code for.</Li><Li><b>Provide a visible signifier for the time left on a security code’s use </b><br />Once you’ve selected an account see how much time you have left to use the code with a handy time bar detailing how long until the code expires. </Li></ul></div></section><section><h3>Conclusion</h3><div><p>Most users wanted to be able to find what they’re looking for quickly. This makes sense as you don’t want two factor auth to be a burden but rather be a protective step. Some next steps may be to determine if there’s a way to provide pictures for each service ahead of time instead of requiring users to upload custom photos. (While still keeping the option there.) It would also be beneficial to test this mockup for the extreme use case of 50+ accounts to ensure that the categories for the filters are correctly set, and make it easier to manage accounts. There’s also the complication of having more than one account for a single service. In this case the custom image option allows the user to upload a separate image for each account. Although in the majority of the cases this picture could potentially be the same. Thus it would be beneficial to design a way to differentiate accounts with the same image displayed from the home screen.</p></div></section><section class="images"><div class="item"><img src="../../images/projects/authentikey/HomeScreen-f2858359.png" alt="" /><span>The Home Screen</span></div><div class="item"><img src="../../images/projects/authentikey/SearchScreen-35bf8140.png" alt="" /><span>The Search Screen</span></div><div class="item"><img src="../../images/projects/authentikey/SortFeature-3363ad64.png" alt="" /><span>The Sort Features</span></div><div class="item"><img src="../../images/projects/authentikey/AddAccount1-22d9ea92.png" alt="" /><span>The Add Account Screen</span></div><div class="item"><img src="../../images/projects/authentikey/EditAccount-544b2659.png" alt="" /><span>The Edit Account Screen</span></div></section></div><footer><div class="contact"><a href="../../about/">Contact Me</a></div><div class="year">2022</div></footer></body></html>
